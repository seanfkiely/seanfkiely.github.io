The sudden popularity of tall vines among grapegrowers took some nurseries
by surprise. Is this popularity rooted in economic reality? This analysis
quantifies the claimed benefits of tall vines relative to regular vines from the
grower’s perspective using a net present value (NPV) model. We leverage these
potted green vine value estimates to discuss the forces that explain the recent
emergence of tall vines in the California grape industry and their prospects for
the future.
