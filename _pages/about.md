I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [ARE Department](https://are.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I will join [The National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/) as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Agricultural Economics in fall 2024. My fields of interest are agricultural, development, and behavioral economics. I am currently studying questions on labeling information, experience effects and motivated beliefs, risk and subjective beliefs, and disability policy in developing countries. I will be available for interviews for the 2024-2025 job market.
