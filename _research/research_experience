### The Impact of Natural Disasters on Risk Preferences, Subjective Beliefs, and Related Behavior: Evidence from Typhoon Ketsana (with Sean F. Kiely) [Working Paper | Slides]

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
We study how individuals' risk preferences, subjective beliefs about future shocks, and related behavior change following a natural disaster. We focus on the impact of Typhoon Ketsana in 2009—one of the most devastating storms to hit Southeast Asia in recent times. Our analysis reveals that individuals who were affected by the typhoon become more risk averse a year after landfall. This effect persists up to four years later. We base our findings on household-level panel data from Vietnam and a difference-in-differences strategy with a continuous treatment variable that exploits variation in the intensity of the typhoon. We conclude that a standard deviation (SD) increase in excess rainfall during the typhoon leads to a 0.23 SD increase in risk averseness one year after landfall, and a 0.24 SD increase four years after landfall. Moreover, individuals exposed to higher excess rainfall are more likely to believe that storms will not transpire in the following five years or will occur with reduced frequency. This result supports the view that the main observed effects on risk preferences indeed reflect updated risk attitudes, rather than changes in the subjective probability structure assigned to the occurrence of storms. Finally, we show that individuals exposed to the typhoon increase their insurance purchasing in the long term. Our paper contributes to the literature that empirically documents how negative shocks may alter risk preferences and helps illuminate the way climate-related hazards can induce changes in the attitudes and economic behavior of individuals.

### Psychological Well-being and Impact Heterogeneity in a Graduation Program in Paraguay (with Michael R. Carter and José Molinas Vega)

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Multifaceted graduation programs modeled after BRAC’s seminal approach aim to reduce poverty by building up physical productive assets and intangible business and life skills. Research on these programs has shown that they generally result in positive average treatment effects across various economic variables, though these results obscure sizeable heterogeneity. This paper studies the heterogeneous impacts of a graduation program and examines psychological well-being as both an outcome affected by the program and as a source of heterogeneity. We exploit a randomized controlled trial with a staggered rollout and a saturation design of a graduation program implemented by the government of Paraguay. Midline results reveal positive effects of the program on income, assets, but no effects on savings. Impacts vary widely across the distribution of participants, with only the top half of the most benefitted participants experiencing a statistically significant increase in income, and the top quartile most benefitted participant experiencing increases in assets four times the size of those in the bottom quartile, according to conditional quantile treatment estimates. Additionally, we find that the program leads to an increase in the number of respondents who report moderate to severe symptoms of depression. The presence of such symptoms at baseline emerges as a key source of impact heterogeneity, with participants who had more severe initial symptoms seeing no statistically significant increase in income and an increase in assets only half the size of those with fewer initial symptoms. The paper discusses what these findings imply for designing and implementing graduation programs in a cost-effective manner.

### The Economics of Sovereign Insurance in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (with Michael R. Carter) [Slides]

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
The increased frequency and severity of natural disasters has spawned the emergence of new tools for disaster risk finance, including sovereign index insurance contracts that provide governments with budgetary support for the costs of infrastructure replacement and excess social protection payments that accumulate in the wake hurricanes and droughts. While there are multiple considerations that go into determining when such contracts are warranted, here we focus core economic considerations: when does the protection offered by such sovereign contracts make good, public finance sense? To answer this question, we propose two conceptual metrics: One is based on minimizing the economic cost of meeting disaster-induced excess budgetary expenditures. The second is based on maximizing social welfare given a fixed government budget. We then illustrate the use of these concepts using data from Kenya and analyzing the efficacy of using an example parametric sovereign risk contract developed to meet Kenya’s excess social protection needs that are caused by drought events in the rangeland areas. While we stress that the benchmark data available to evaluate the contract are imperfect, we find that the proposed contract performs better under both metrics than a go-it-alone (no insurance) policy, even when we assume commercial mark-up rates on the insurance. We also find that the proposed contract falls well short of what a perfect parametric contract could achieve, suggesting the importance of quality assessment methodologies to compare alternative options. Overall, we propose a methodology that allows comparing the performances of different sovereign-level parametric insurance contracts and setting up a minimum quality threshold.

### Asset Protection and Disaster Risk Financing to Improve Shock-responsive Social Protection in Latin America and the Caribbean (with Michael R. Carter)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the poorest and most vulnerable households largely engage in informal work/self-employment and are beyond the reach of conventional income maintenance programs that provide shock-responsive social protection for the formally employed. While the poorest households sometimes benefit from conditional cash transfers and economic inclusion asset building programs, making these programs shock-responsive requires recognizing these households as active economic actors who need to build and protect the assets that are key to their livelihood and resilience. Although there has been some progress toward making cash transfer schemes shock-responsive, we argue that effective social protection for this population must extend beyond scalable cash payments and offer customizable asset protection schemes tailored to individual asset exposure. The payoffs to such schemes could be substantial in terms of improved asset accumulation incentives and long-term poverty reduction and resilience. These schemes could leverage parametric disaster risk financing instruments of the sort already present in the region to provide predictable, reliable, and customizable support to the target population. In addition to our core argument concerning the protection of the poorest in LAC, we also consider the role of parametric or index insurance products in underwriting scalable social protection obligations of governments. Our analysis suggests a cautionary perspective on the conventional logic about the important role that parametric insurance products can play as a form of stochastic government support. We show that the degree of reliance on these products depends critically on the reliability of the underlying parametric index. This point is especially important given our emphasis on the necessity of reliable social protection programs that enhance and sustain asset building and protection for the poorest.
